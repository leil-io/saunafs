== DESCRIPTION

*sfsmaster* is the metadata server program of Sauna File System. Depending on
parameters it can start, restart or stop SaunaFS metadata server process.
Without any options it starts SaunaFS metadata server, killing previously run
process if lock file exists.

Metadata server can work in one of two modes (personalities):

. master . shadow

If metadata server works with 'master' personality it acts as main metadata
server govering all file system metadata modifications. If metadata server
works with 'shadow' personality it acts as backup metadata server ready for
immediate deployment as new 'master' in case of current 'master' failure.
Shadow only accepts connections from saunafs-admin, i.e. sfschunkserver,
sfsmetalogger and sfsmount (the client) are not allowed to connect to 'shadow'
instance.

Current metadata server personality is defined in metadata server configuration
file and can be changed on the fly from 'shadow' to 'master' by proper
modification and reloading of its configuration file.

'Master' and 'shadow' are designed to run simultaneously in sync forever. It is
very unlikely but still (due to a memory corruption or a bug) possible that
after some time their metadata will somehow differ. Since version 2.5.2
metadata checksum is maintained both by 'master' and 'shadow', in order to
detect and fix possible metadata corruptions. In case mismatch is detected
'shadow' asks 'master' to double check its metadata and dump its current
snapshot. After the metadata is dumped and the checksum in 'master' is
recalculated shadow downloads the new metadata snapshot, which should ensure
that master and all shadows have exactly the same metadata.

SIGHUP (or 'reload' 'ACTION') forces *sfsmaster* to reload all configuration
files.

*-v*::
print version information and exit

*-h*::
print usage information and exit

*-f*::
(deprecated, use *start* action instead) forcily run SaunaFS master process,
without trying to kill previous instance (this option allows to run SaunaFS
master if stale PID file exists)

*-s*::
(deprecated, use *stop* action instead)
stop SaunaFS master process

*-c* 'CFGFILE'::
specify alternative path of configuration file (default is *sfsmaster.cfg* in
system configuration directory)

*-u*::
log undefined configuration values (when default is assumed)

*-d*::
run in foreground, don't daemonize

*-t* 'LOCKTIMEOUT'::
how long to wait for lockfile (default is 60 seconds)

'ACTION'::
is the one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *reload*, *test*, *isalive* or
*kill*. Default action is *restart*.
