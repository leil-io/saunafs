saunafs-uraft-helper - SaunaFS HA suite helper

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
saunafs-uraft-helper

== DESCRIPTION

*saunafs-uraft-helper* is a helper script, used internally by *saunafs-uraft*
to manage nodes. The script should implement the following operations: isalive
metadata-version quick-stop promote demote assign-ip drop-ip

Except from *isalive*, this script should not be used on its own. If anyone
needs special actions to be taken during *saunafs-uraft* management stages
(such as promotion, demotion), editing this script is sufficient to do so.
