================

== NAME

sfsmaster.cfg - main configuration file for sfsmaster

== DESCRIPTION

The file *sfsmaster.cfg* contains configuration of SaunaFS metadata server process.

== SYNTAX

Syntax is:

'OPTION' *=* 'VALUE'

Lines starting with *#* character are ignored.

== OPTIONS

Configuration options:

*PERSONALITY*::
Current 'personality' of this instance of metadata server. Valid values are 'master', 'shadow'
and 'ha-cluster-managed'. If installation is managed by an HA cluster the only valid value is
'ha-cluster-managed', otherwise the only valid values are 'master' and 'shadow', in which case
only one metadata server in SaunaFS shall have 'master' personality. +
PERSONALITY = 'master' +
means that this instance of metadata server acts as main metadata server
govering all file system metadata modifications. +
PERSONALITY = 'shadow' +
means that this instance of metadata server acts as backup metadata server
ready for immediate deployment as new 'master' in case of current 'master' failure. +
Metadata server personality can be changed at any moment as long as one changes personality from
'shadow' to 'master', changing personality the other way around is forbidden. +
PERSONALITY = 'ha-cluster-managed' +
means that this instance is managed by HA cluster, server runs in 'shadow' mode as long as its not remotely promoted to 'master'.

*DATA_PATH*::
where to store metadata files and lock file

*WORKING_USER*::
user to run daemon as

*WORKING_GROUP*::
group to run daemon as (optional - if empty then default user group will be used)

*SYSLOG_IDENT*::
name of process to place in syslog messages (default is sfsmaster)

*LOCK_MEMORY*::
whether to perform mlockall() to avoid swapping out sfsmaster process (default is 0, i.e. no)

*NICE_LEVEL*::
nice level to run daemon with (default is -19 if possible; note: process must be started as root to
increase priority)

*EXPORTS_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *sfsexports.cfg* file

*TOPOLOGY_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *sfstopology.cfg* file

*CUSTOM_GOALS_FILENAME*::
alternative name of *sfsgoals.cfg* file

*PREFER_LOCAL_CHUNKSERVER*::
If a client mountpoint has a local chunkserver, and a given chunk happens to
reside locally, then sfsmaster will list the local chunkserver first.
However, when the local client mount is issuing many read(s)/write(s), to many
local chunks, these requests can overload the local chunkserver and disk
subsystem.  Setting this to 0(the default is 1) means that remote chunkservers
will be considered as equivalent to the local chunkserver. +
This is useful when the network is faster than the disk, and when there is
high-IO load on the client mountpoints.

*BACK_LOGS*::
number of metadata change log files (default is 50)

*BACK_META_KEEP_PREVIOUS*::
number of previous metadata files to be kept (default is 1)

*AUTO_RECOVERY*::
when this option is set (equals 1) master will try to recover metadata from changelog when it
is being started after a crash; otherwise it will refuse to start and 'sfsmetarestore' should be
used to recover the metadata (default is 0)

*REPLICATIONS_DELAY_INIT*::
DEPRECATED - see *OPERATIONS_DELAY_INIT*

*REPLICATIONS_DELAY_DISCONNECT*::
DEPRECATED - see *OPERATIONS_DELAY_DISCONNECT*

*OPERATIONS_DELAY_INIT*::
initial delay in seconds before starting chunk operations (default is 300)

chunk operations delay in seconds after chunkserver disconnection (default is 3600)

*MATOML_LISTEN_HOST*::
IP address to listen on for metalogger connections (*** means any)

*MATOML_LISTEN_PORT*::
port to listen on for metalogger connections (default is 9419)

*MATOML_LOG_PRESERVE_SECONDS*::
how many seconds of change logs have to be preserved in memory (default is 600; note: logs are
stored in blocks of 5k lines, so sometimes real number of seconds may be little bigger; zero
disables extra logs storage)

*MATOCS_LISTEN_HOST*::
IP address to listen on for chunkserver connections (*** means any)

*MATOCS_LISTEN_PORT*::
port to listen on for chunkserver connections (default is 9420)

Chunks loop shouldn't check more chunks per seconds than given number (default is 100000)

*CHUNKS_LOOP_MIN_TIME*::
Chunks loop will check all chunks in specified time (default is 300) unless *CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*
will force slower execution.

*CHUNKS_LOOP_PERIOD*::
Time in milliseconds between chunks loop execution (default is 1000).

*CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPU*::
Hard limit on CPU usage by chunks loop (percentage value, default is 60).

*CHUNKS_HARD_DEL_LIMIT*::
Hard maximum number of chunks to delete on one chunkserver (default is 25)

*CHUNKS_WRITE_REP_LIMIT*::
Maximum number of chunks to replicate to one chunkserver (default is 2)

*CHUNKS_READ_REP_LIMIT*::
Maximum number of chunks to replicate from one chunkserver (default is 10)

*ENDANGERED_CHUNKS_PRIORITY*::
Percentage of endangered chunks that should be replicated with high priority.
Example: when set to 0.2, up to 20% of chunks served in one turn would be extracted
from endangered priority queue.
When set to 1 (max), no other chunks would be processed as long as there are
any endangered chunks in the queue (not advised)
(default is 0, i.e. there is no overhead for prioritizing endangered chunks).

*ENDANGERED_CHUNKS_MAX_CAPACITY*::
Max capacity of endangered chunks queue. This value can limit memory usage of master server
if there are lots of endangered chunks in the system.
This value is ignored if ENDANGERED_CHUNKS_PRIORITY is set to 0.
(default is 1Mi, i.e. no more than 1Mi chunks will be kept in a queue).

*ACCEPTABLE_DIFFERENCE*::
A maximum difference between disk usage on chunkservers that doesn't trigger chunk rebalancing
(default is 0.1, i.e. 10%).

*CHUNKS_REBALANCING_BETWEEN_LABELS*::
When balancing disk usage, allow moving chunks between servers with different labels
(default is 0, i.e. chunks will be moved only between servers with the same label).

*REJECT_OLD_CLIENTS*::

How often mountpoints will request bandwidth allocations under constant, predictable load
(default is 0.1)

*GLOBALIOLIMITS_ACCUMULATE_MS*::

data flow over the period of that many milliseconds (default is 250)

*METADATA_CHECKSUM_INTERVAL*::
how often metadata checksum shall be sent to backup servers (default is: every 50 metadata updates)

*METADATA_CHECKSUM_RECALCULATION_SPEED*::
how fast should metadata be recalculated in background (default : 100 objects per function call)

*DISABLE_METADATA_CHECKSUM_VERIFICATION*::
should checksum verification be disabled while applying changelog

*NO_ATIME*::
when this option is set to 1 inode access time is not updated on every access, otherwise
(when set to 0) it is updated (default is 0)

*METADATA_SAVE_REQUEST_MIN_PERIOD*::
minimal time in seconds between metadata dumps caused by requests from shadow masters
(default is 1800)

*SESSION_SUSTAIN_TIME*::
Time in seconds for which client session data (e.g. list of open files) should be sustained
in the master server after connection with the client was lost.

using those that share the same ip. (default is 0)

*REDUNDANCY_LEVEL*::
minimum number of required redundant chunk parts that can be lost before chunk becomes endangered
(default is 0)

*SNAPSHOT_INITIAL_BATCH_SIZE*::
This option can be used to specify initial number of snapshotted nodes that will be atomically cloned
before enqueuing the task for execution in fixed-sized batches. (default is 1000)

*SNAPSHOT_INITIAL_BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT*::
This option specifies the maximum initial batch size set for snapshot request. (default is 10000)

*FILE_TEST_LOOP_MIN_TIME*
Test files loop will try to check all files in specified time in seconds (default is 3600).
It's possible for the loop to take more time if the master server is busy or the machine
doesn't have enough processing power to make all the needed calculations.

Options below are mandatory for all Shadow instances:

*MASTER_HOST*::
address of the host running SaunaFS metadata server that currently acts as 'master'

*MASTER_PORT*::
port number where SaunaFS metadata server currently running as 'master' listens for connections
from 'shadow's and metaloggers (default is 9420)

*MASTER_RECONNECTION_DELAY*::
delay in seconds before trying to reconnect to metadata server after disconnection (default is 1)

*MASTER_TIMEOUT*::
timeout (in seconds) for metadata server connections (default is 60)

*LOAD_FACTOR_PENALTY*::
When set, percentage of load will be added to chunkserver disk usage to determine most fitting
chunkserver. Heavy loaded chunkservers will be picked for operations less frequently.
(default is 0, correct values are in range from 0 to 0.5)

== NOTES

Chunks in master are tested in loop. Speed (or frequency) is regulated by two options
*CHUNKS_LOOP_MIN_TIME* and *CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*. First defines minimal time of the loop and second
maximal number of chunk tests per second. Typically at the beginning, when number of chunks is
small, time is constant, regulated by *CHUNK_LOOP_MIN_TIME*, but when number of chunks became bigger
then time of loop can increase according to *CHUNKS_LOOP_MAX_CPS*.

Deletion limits are defined as 'soft' and 'hard' limit. When number of chunks to delete increases
from loop to loop then current limit can be temporary increased above soft limit, but never above
hard limit.
