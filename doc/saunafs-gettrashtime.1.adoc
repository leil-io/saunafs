========================

== NAME

saunafs-gettrashtime, saunafs-settrashtime, saunafs-rgettrashtime, saunafs-rsettrashtime - get or set trash time

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*saunafs gettrashtime* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*saunafs rgettrashtime* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*saunafs settrashtime* [*-r*] [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] SECONDS[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...

[verse]
*saunafs rsettrashtime* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] SECONDS[*+*|*-*] 'OBJECT'...


== DESCRIPTION

*gettrashtime* and *settrashtime* operate on object's 'trashtime' value, i.e. the number of
seconds the file is preserved in special 'trash' directory before it's finally removed from
filesystem. 'Trashtime' must be non-negative integer value. *gettrashtime* prints current
'trashtime' value of given object(s).

== OPTIONS

*-r*::
This option enables recursive mode, which works as usual for every given file, but for every given
directory additionally prints current 'trashtime' value of all contained objects (files and
directories).

'N'\[*+*|*-*]::
If new value is specified in 'N'*+* form, 'trashtime' value is increased to 'N' for objects with
lower 'trashtime' value and unchanged for the rest. Similarly, if new value is specified as 'N'*-*,
'trashtime' value is decreased to 'N' for objects with higher 'trashtime' value and unchanged for
the rest. These tools can be used on any file, directory or deleted ('trash') file.

*-n*, *-h*, *-H*::
These options are described in saunafs(1).

== NOTE

*rgettrashtime* and *rsettrashtime* are deprecated aliases for
*gettrashtime -r* and *settrashtime -r* respectively.
