== NAME

saunafs-filerepair - repair broken files

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*saunafs filerepair* [*-n*|*-h*|*-H*] 'FILE'...

== DESCRIPTION

*filerepair* deals with broken files (those which cause I/O errors on read
operations) to make them partially readable. In case of missing chunk it fills
missing parts of file with zeros; in case of chunk version mismatch it sets
chunk version known to *sfsmaster* to highest one found on chunkservers.

NOTE: Because in the second case content mismatch can occur in chunks with the
same version, it's advised to make a copy (not a snapshot!) and delete original
file after "repairing".

== OPTIONS

*-c*::
This option enables correct-only mode, which will restore chunk to a previous
version if possible, but will never erase any data.

*-n*, *-h*, *-H*::
These options are described in saunafs(1).

== REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs to the Github repository <https://github.com/leil/saunafs> as an
