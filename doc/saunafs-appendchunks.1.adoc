== NAME

saunafs-appendchunks - lazy append chunks

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*saunafs appendchunks* 'SNAPSHOT_FILE' 'OBJECT'...

== DESCRIPTION

*appendchunks* (equivalent of *sfssnapshot*) appends a lazy copy of specified
file(s) to specified snapshot file ("lazy" means that creation of new chunks is
delayed to the moment one copy is modified). If multiple files are given, they
are merged into one target file in the way that each file begins at 'chunk'
(64MB) boundary; padding space is left empty.
