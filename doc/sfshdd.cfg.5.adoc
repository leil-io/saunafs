sfshdd.cfg(5)
=============

== NAME

sfshdd.cfg - list of SaunaFS storage directories for sfschunkserver

== DESCRIPTION

The file *sfshdd.cfg* contains list of directories (mountpoints) used for SaunaFS storage (one per
line). Directory prefixed by *** character causes given directory to be freed by replicating all
data already stored there to another locations. Lines starting with *#* character are ignored.

The chunks are divided into metadata (.met) and data (.dat) parts. The metadata parts contain
information about the chunks, while data parts are only aligned data. It is possible to store the
metadata parts in a different directory, or even in a separate drive, by splitting both paths
using ' | ':

/path/to/metadata | /path/to/data

This way, the metadata parts can be stored, for instance, in NVMe and the data parts in HDD.
