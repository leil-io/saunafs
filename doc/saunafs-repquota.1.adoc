====================

== NAME

saunafs-repquota, saunafs-setquota - retrieves and sets quotas for specified users and groups

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
*saunafs repquota* [*-nhH*] (*-u* 'UID' | *-g* 'GID')+ 'MOUNTPOINT-ROOT-PATH'

[verse]
*saunafs repquota* [*-nhH*] -a 'MOUNTPOINT-ROOT-PATH'

[verse]
*saunafs repquota* [*-nhH*] -d 'DIRECTORY-PATH'

[verse]
*saunafs setquota* (*-u* 'UID' | *-g* 'GID') 'SOFT-LIMIT-SIZE' 'HARD-LIMIT-SIZE'
              'SOFT-LIMIT-INODES' 'HARD-LIMIT-INODES' 'MOUNTPOINT-ROOT-PATH'

[verse]
*saunafs setquota* -d 'SOFT-LIMIT-SIZE' 'HARD-LIMIT-SIZE'
              'SOFT-LIMIT-INODES' 'HARD-LIMIT-INODES' 'DIRECTORY-PATH'

== OPTIONS

*-u* 'UID'::
Quota for the user with uid 'UID'.

*-g* 'GID'::
Quota for the group with gid 'GID'.

*-a*::
Quota for all users and groups.

*-d*::
Quota for directory.

== DESCRIPTION

Quota mechanism can be used to limit inodes usage and space usage for users and groups. Once hard
limit for inodes or space is reached, no new files can be created for specified user (or group) as
long as the quota is not raised or some data is deleted. Also, if hard limit for size is reached,
user cannot extend existing files by adding new chunks to them.

In general quotas can be set only by a superuser, but there is a workaround available - one can set
SESFLAG_ALLCANCHANGEQUOTA in sfsexports.cfg file. A user can only retrieve a quota of his own (and
of his primary group).

*repquota* prints a summary of the limits that were set and inode/space usage for specified
user/group (or all of them) in the following format:

[verse]
# User/Group ID/Inode; Bytes: current usage, soft limit, hard limit; Inodes: current usage, soft limit, hard limit;
'User/Group/Inode' 'ID' '(`+`/-)(`+`/-)' 'USED-BYTES' 'SOFT-LIMIT-BYTES' 'HARD-LIMIT-BYTES' 'USED-INODES' 'SOFT-LIMIT-INODES' 'HARD-LIMIT-INODES'

'`+`' indicates that the soft was exceeded or the hard limit was reached. '-' indicates otherwise.
The first '`+`' or '-' corresponds to bytes limit, while the second one to inodes.

*setquota* sets quotas for a user or a group on SaunaFS. The quotas are not strict, i.e. it is
possible to exceed hard limits a bit, mostly by appending data to existing files, but only to
certain level (new chunks cannot be created).
