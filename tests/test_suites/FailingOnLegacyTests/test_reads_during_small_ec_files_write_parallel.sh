# This script tests an optimization in handling 
# small files during Erasure Coding (EC) writes. 
# It addresses a previous issue where the client 
# would unnecessarily request missing data parts 
# from chunk servers, even beyond the file size, 
# adding overhead. The script creates a small 
# 1-byte file with known content and writes this 
# content at specific positions (0, 64K, 128K, 192K) 
# on two mount points. After each write operation, 
# it reads back the data from these positions and 
# checks that the read data is the same as the 
# known content. It also checks that there were 
# no extra reads during these operations. 
# This test ensures that remaining blocks are not 
# requested, eliminating unnecessary requests, 
# reducing overhead, and improving efficiency, 
# especially for small files.
