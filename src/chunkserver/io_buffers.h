 * The OutputBuffer class is responsible for managing the data to be written to

 * it to the file descriptor.
 *
 * The buffer is divided into three parts:
 *
 * - Header: The header of the packet.
 *
 * - CRC: The CRC of the block of data.
 *
 * - Block: The data block to be sent.
 *
 * The buffer is prepared to write the data to the file descriptor at once. The order of
 * the final write interleaves the header, the CRC, and the block. All the headers are
 * supposed to have the same length, which must be provided during the buffer creation.
 * The sizes of CRC (kCrcSize) and the block (SFSBLOCKSIZE) buffers per block are fixed.
 *
 * The block buffer is aligned to the disk I/O block size. To get the expected behavior the only
 * block which may not be complete is the last one.
