///
/// The class aims to achieve the following constraints:
///  * selecting a single chunk at random in constant time,
///  * able to shuffle all chunks into a random order,
///  * constant-time operations of insertion, deletion, mark as tested, and get-chunk-to-test.
///
/// This collection uses the `indexInDisk` field in the Chunk structure to be
/// able to achieve constant-time operations. Elements of this collection are swapped
/// around rather than being inserted into the underlying vector at arbitrary locations;
/// when elements are swapped, their `indexInDisk` field needs to be updated as well.
