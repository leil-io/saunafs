/*! \brief Goal counting class for chunks
 *
 * This class is used to calculate superposition of goals
 * for chunks belonging to multiple inodes (e.g. through snapshotting).
 * Chunks referenced by 1 inode inherit their goal without any computations.
 *
 * Underlying data structure is a compact_vector, which is designed to occupy
 * as little memory as needed.
 *
 * Superposition is counted as a set sum of existing goals.
 * Example:
 *  goal of file1: label1 label2
 *  goal of file2: label2 label3
 *  counted goal of chunk shared between file1 and file2: label1 label2 label3
 *  counted goal of shared chunk after changing file1 goal to _: label2 label3
