/*! \brief Implementation of Recursive Remove Task that works with Task Manager.
 *
 * RemoveTask class is used for removing files and directories with
 * their entire content. Each task is responsible for removing one node and
 * it's execution depends on the type of node. If node is a not empty directory,
 * it adds it's children to the front of the queue of tasks. Otherwise, if node
 * is empty or not a directory, task removes the node and itself from the queue.
 *
 * Processing of enqueued tasks is done by Task Manager class.
