/// Section-local undo recorder for the edge metadata section (EDGE).
///
/// The forkless backend keeps only the newest directory topology in the live EDGE_ keys, and
/// that image always drifts forward as the master links, renames, and unlinks entries. To let a
/// later load (in particular shadow sync) reconstruct topology as of a sealed checkpoint version,
/// this recorder captures the pre-image of the first edge mutation in each checkpoint interval
/// into cold undo rows, and replays them in reverse on restore.
///
/// Undo keyspace: EDGEU_<checkpointVersion:u64><parentId:inode_t><name> (kEdgeUndoKeyPrefix). The
/// value is the pre-image child id (the prior EDGE_ value), or an empty-value tombstone when the
/// edge did not exist before the first mutation in the interval.
///
/// Lifecycle: MetadataWriterFDB calls beforeMutation() before an edge live key is written or
/// removed, inside the same write transaction. The checkpoint manager calls
/// restoreToCheckpointVersion() during load to roll the live topology back, dropCheckpointData()
/// when a checkpoint is trimmed from the retained catalog, and resetIntervalState() after a
/// checkpoint is sealed so first-touch tracking restarts for the next interval.
///
/// Section-local scope: this recorder rebuilds directory topology only (entry maps, link counts,
/// aggregated directory stats), delegating the actual in-memory attach/detach to
/// metadata_edge_restore_helpers. It must not restore node bodies owned by the NODE section,
/// which are rolled back first; see ISectionUndoRecorder and the section-local restore contract
/// in MetadataCheckpointManager.
