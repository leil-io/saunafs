/// bodies and node-local accounting (per-type counters, open-file sessions, quotas, checksums,
/// and inode-pool state), but they deliberately do not rebuild directory topology owned by the
/// EDGE section. Replacement and removal are rejected when the target node still has parent
/// links or edge-owned directory entries attached, so a node restore can never implicitly
/// mutate another section's state.
