/// Section-local undo recorder for the chunk metadata section (CHNK).
///
/// The forkless backend keeps only the newest chunk state in the live CHNL_ keys, and that
/// image always drifts forward as the master mutates chunks. To let a later load (in
/// particular shadow sync) reconstruct chunk state as of a sealed checkpoint version, this
/// recorder captures the pre-image of the first chunk mutation in each checkpoint interval
/// into cold undo rows, and replays them in reverse on restore.
///
/// Undo keyspace: CHNU_<checkpointVersion:u64><chunkId:u64> (kChunkUndoKeyPrefix). The value
/// is the serialized CHNL_ pre-image (chunkVersion, lockedTo, lockId), or an empty-value
/// tombstone when the chunk did not exist before the first mutation in the interval.
///
/// Lifecycle: MetadataWriterFDB calls beforeMutation() before a chunk live key is written,
/// inside the same write transaction. The checkpoint manager calls restoreToCheckpointVersion()
/// during load to roll the live image back, dropCheckpointData() when a checkpoint is trimmed
/// from the retained catalog, and resetIntervalState() after a checkpoint is sealed so
/// first-touch tracking restarts for the next interval.
///
/// Section-local scope: this recorder rebuilds chunk-table state only. It must not touch node
/// bodies, edges, or any other section's owned state; see ISectionUndoRecorder and the
/// section-local restore contract in MetadataCheckpointManager.
