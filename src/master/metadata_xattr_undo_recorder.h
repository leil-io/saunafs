/// Section-local undo recorder for the extended-attribute metadata section (XATR).
///
/// The forkless backend keeps only the newest xattrs in the live XATR_ keys, and that image
/// always drifts forward as the master sets and removes attributes. To let a later load (in
/// particular shadow sync) reconstruct xattrs as of a sealed checkpoint version, this recorder
/// captures the pre-image of the first mutation of each xattr in a checkpoint interval into cold
/// undo rows, and replays them in reverse on restore.
///
/// Unlike free inodes, xattrs are NOT coupled to node create/delete: node rollback does not
/// restore them, and the xattr checksum is part of the metadata checksum. Without this recorder a
/// drifted XATR_ image causes a shadow checksum mismatch (see test_shadow_xattr_sync_with_fdb.sh).
///
/// Undo keyspace: XATRU_<checkpointVersion:u64><inode:inode_t><name> (kXAttrUndoKeyPrefix). The
/// value is a one-byte presence flag followed by the pre-image value: 0x01 + value when the xattr
/// existed, or a single 0x00 tombstone byte when it did not. The flag is required because xattrs
/// may legitimately hold an empty value.
///
/// Lifecycle: MetadataWriterFDB calls beforeMutation() before an xattr live key is written or
/// removed, inside the same write transaction. The checkpoint manager calls
/// restoreToCheckpointVersion() during load to roll the live xattrs back, dropCheckpointData()
/// when a checkpoint is trimmed from the retained catalog, and resetIntervalState() after a
/// checkpoint is sealed. The durable undo key is the authoritative first-touch guard, so there is
/// no recorder-local interval state to reset.
///
/// Section-local scope: this recorder restores xattr entries only, via xattr_setattr() with
/// signal emits suppressed. It does not touch node bodies or topology; see ISectionUndoRecorder
/// and the section-local restore contract in MetadataCheckpointManager.
