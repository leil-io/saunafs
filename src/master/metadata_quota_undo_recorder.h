/// Section-local undo recorder for the quota metadata section (QUOT).
///
/// The forkless backend keeps only the newest quota limits in the live QUOT_ keys, and that image
/// drifts forward as the master runs setquota. To let a later load (in particular shadow sync)
/// reconstruct limits as of a sealed checkpoint version, this recorder captures the pre-image of
/// the first mutation of each owner in a checkpoint interval into cold undo rows, and replays them
/// in reverse on restore.
///
/// Only soft/hard limits are persisted and checksummed; usage (kUsed) is rebuilt from node loading
/// and excluded. Like xattrs, quota limits are NOT node-coupled, so without this recorder a
/// drifted QUOT_ image causes a shadow checksum mismatch (see test_shadow_quota_sync.sh).
///
/// Undo keyspace: QUOTU_<checkpointVersion:u64><ownerType:u8><ownerId:inode_t>
/// (kQuotaUndoKeyPrefix). Both quota mutations rewrite/remove the owner's whole QUOT_ range, so the
/// recorder captures the owner's full pre-image: a one-byte presence flag, then (when present) four
/// u64 limits in soft/hard x inodes/size order, or a single 0x00 tombstone byte when the owner had
/// no limits.
///
/// Lifecycle: MetadataWriterFDB calls beforeMutation() before an owner's limit rows are written or
/// removed, inside the same write transaction. The checkpoint manager calls
/// restoreToCheckpointVersion() during load to roll limits back, dropCheckpointData() when a
/// checkpoint is trimmed, and resetIntervalState() after a checkpoint is sealed.
///

/// does not touch nodes or usage; see ISectionUndoRecorder and the section-local restore contract
