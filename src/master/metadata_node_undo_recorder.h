/// Section-local undo recorder for the node metadata section (NODE).
///
/// The forkless backend keeps only the newest node state in the live NODE_ keys, and that
/// image always drifts forward as the master creates, modifies, and removes nodes. To let a
/// later load (in particular shadow sync) reconstruct node state as of a sealed checkpoint
/// version, this recorder captures the pre-image of the first node mutation in each checkpoint
/// interval into cold undo rows, and replays them in reverse on restore.
///
/// Undo keyspace: NODEU_<checkpointVersion:u64><nodeId:inode_t> (kNodeUndoKeyPrefix). The value
/// is the serialized node pre-image, or an empty-value tombstone when the node did not exist
/// before the first mutation in the interval.
///
/// Lifecycle: MetadataWriterFDB calls beforeMutation() before a node live key is written or
/// removed, inside the same write transaction. The checkpoint manager calls
/// restoreToCheckpointVersion() during load to roll the live image back, dropCheckpointData()
/// when a checkpoint is trimmed from the retained catalog, and resetIntervalState() after a
/// checkpoint is sealed. The durable undo key is the authoritative first-touch guard, so there is
/// no recorder-local interval state to reset.
///
/// Section-local scope: this recorder restores node bodies and node-local accounting only,
/// delegating the actual in-memory replacement/removal to metadata_node_restore_helpers. It
/// must not rebuild directory topology owned by the EDGE section; see ISectionUndoRecorder and
/// the section-local restore contract in MetadataCheckpointManager.
