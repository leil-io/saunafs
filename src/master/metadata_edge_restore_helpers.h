/// Edge-only restore helpers used by EdgeUndoRecorder to apply rollback to the in-memory
/// directory tree.
///
/// These helpers implement the section-local contract for the EDGE section: they rebuild
/// directory topology (the parent's entry map and entries hash, the child's parent
/// back-pointers, the directory link count, and recursively aggregated directory stats), but
/// they deliberately do not touch node bodies (mode, times, length, checksums) which are owned
/// and restored by the NODE section. The full metadata checksum is recomputed once after all
/// sections load, so the helpers do not maintain per-node checksums.
///
/// Unlike the runtime link()/removeEdge() operations, these helpers are signal-free: they must
/// not emit edgeChangedSignal/edgeRemovedSignal/nodeChangedSignal. During load the metadata
/// writer is already active on a master, so emitting a signal here would re-enqueue a spurious
/// EDGE_ write and corrupt the persisted image. They mirror the in-memory attach performed by
/// MetadataBackendForkless::loadEdge() (which also ignores case-insensitive lower-case entries).

/// Restores an edge so that (parentId, name) maps to childId in memory.
///
/// Resolves parentId to a directory and childId to a node (both must already exist; the NODE
/// section is rolled back before edges). If an edge with name already maps to childId, the call
/// is a no-op. If it maps to a different child, that edge is detached first. Then the child is
/// attached under name: inserted into the parent's entry map, linked back via child->parents,
/// the directory link count is bumped for directory children, and the child's stats are added to
/// the parent subtree.
