/// - **In-memory implementation** (Master, Shadows): Transactions are not used; the context
///   remains empty and is effectively ignored.
/// - **Distributed implementations** (e.g., FoundationDB-based MDS): The context carries an
///   active transaction, allowing efficient batching and atomic commits.

/// to ensure proper ownership of transaction resources.
