# sfsgoals.cfg(5)
# An example of configuration of goals. It contains the default values.

1 1 : _
2 2 : _ _
3 3 : _ _ _
4 4 : _ _ _ _
5 5 : _ _ _ _ _

# (...)

# 20 20 : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

# Defaults (min(goal_id, 5) standard copies) are assumed for unspecified goals.
# Custom goals can be defined with or without labels.
#
# EXAMPLES:
# One of the default goals (three copies anywhere)
#  3 3 : _ _ _

# Only one copy
#  8 not_important_file : _

# Two copies
# 9 important_file : _ _

# Four copies
# 10 very_important_file : _ _ _ _

# At least one copy in the chunkserver labeled 'mars', and second copy
# anywhere (including any other chunkserver labelled mars)
# 11 local_copy_on_mars : mars _

# One copy on the chunkserver labeled 'ssd', and second on 'hdd'
# 12 cached_on_ssd : ssd hdd

# One copy in A, one in B, third anywhere
# 13 min_two_locations : _ locationA locationB

# One copy on 'ssd' chunkserver, two on any chunkserver
# 14 fast_access : ssd _ _

# One on WD labeled chunkserver, one on HT labeled chunkserver
# 15 two_manufacturers : WD HT

# EC examples:

# Erasure code with 5 data parts and 2 parity parts on 7 different chunkservers
# 16 default_ec : $ec(5,2)

# Erasure code with 17 data parts and 9 parity parts with at least
# two parts on ssd
# 17 wide_ec : $ec(17,9) { ssd ssd }

# Erasure code with 3 parts on chunkservers with label 'ssd', and the two other
# parts on 'hdd'
# 18 three_ssd_two_hdd : $ec(3,2) { ssd ssd ssd hdd hdd }

# You can also just specify the some few parts, and leave the rest as any.
# Erasure code with 3 parts on chunkservers with label 'ssd', and the other two
# parts on any other chunkserver (including chunkservers labeled 'ssd' that
# weren't chosen before.
# 19 three_ssd_two_any : $ec(3,2) { ssd ssd ssd }
