///  - Invalid argument values (e.g. a bad versionstamp offset) are std::invalid_argument.
///  - Calls in the wrong transaction state throw TransactionStateError (a std::logic_error).
/// The local domains carry no backend error code, so they can never be mistaken for (or
/// fed into) backend retry handling.
///
/// Read contract: an empty result (nullopt) means only that the key does not exist.
/// Every backend read failure throws this family, the retryable subclass for transient
/// errors the op boundary may replay, this base type for everything else, so a backend
/// failure can never be mistaken for a missing key.
