/// @class ProducerConsumerQueueWithPriority
/// @brief A thread-safe queue for producer-consumer scenarios.
///
/// Can be configured to support several priority levels. Final interface is queue-like,
/// but preferring higher priority items and preserving order within each priority level.
/// The maxSize parameter can be used to limit the number of items the queue should hold, but
/// won't block put() calls and is just going to return false for tryPut() calls when the limit is
/// reached.
///
/// This class provides a thread-safe queue implementation that allows multiple
/// producers and consumers to add and remove items concurrently. It uses a
/// mutex and condition variables to ensure thread safety and to manage the
/// queue's state.
///
/// This class is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to decouple
/// the production and consumption of data, such as:
/// * Multi-threaded applications where one or more threads are generating data
///   and one or more threads are processing that data.
/// * Asynchronous applications where one or more tasks are scheduled and
///   another module processes the tasks.
///
/// // Example usage:
/// ProducerConsumerQueueWithPriority queue(10, deleterByType<YourDataType>);
///
/// // Producer thread
/// std::thread producer([&queue]() {
///     for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
///         auto data = new YourDataType();
///         // Initialize data...
///         queue.put(i, 0, reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(data), sizeof(YourDataType));
///     }
/// });
///
/// // Consumer thread
/// std::thread consumer([&queue]() {
///     for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
///         uint32_t jobId, jobType, length;
///         uint8_t* data;
///         queue.get(&jobId, &jobType, &data, &length);
///         auto yourData = reinterpret_cast<YourDataType*>(data);
///         // Process data...
///         delete yourData;
///     }
/// });
