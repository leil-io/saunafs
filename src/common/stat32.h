/**
 * This file redefines the stat struct coming with the system for the Windows
 * builds, for the Linux builds it just takes the coming definition with
 * sys/stat. The target of this file is to align the stat structure with what
 * is expecting the SaunaFS system to reduce warnings like narrow-conversion and
 * to tackle the issue with uint16_t gid field coming with Windows default stat.
 * Those 16 bits for the gid field causes overflow in our Windows client and
 * must be changed.
