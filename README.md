## About

[SaunaFS](https://saunafs.com) is a free and open source, distributed POSIX
file system inspired by [Google File
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System). Designed to run on
commodity hardware, SaunaFS is a high-performance, scalable, and reliable file
system that provides high availability, data integrity, fault tolerance, and
performance on par with local file systems. It it easy to deploy and manage,
and it is designed to be used in a wide range of applications, from small
clusters to large data centers.


### Feature List

* Resilient architecture to ensure seamless operation organized into distinct components (Metadata servers, data servers, clients).
* Continuous assured data integrity and verification with CRC data stored within each chunk’s metadata.
* Robust redundancy and enhanced data durability with Reed-Solomon erasure coding when up to two nodes can disappear without service interruption.
* Instant Copy-on-Write Snapshots to implement immutability.
* Data preservation and recovery with instant snapshotting mechanism.
* Fast metadata logging for  with support for access time attribute.
* Seamless hardware refresh and expansion without downtime.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Please refer to the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions
on how to install SaunaFS.

### Setup

Check the [Quick Start guide](https://docs.saunafs.com/quick-start) for a
simple setup of SaunaFS on a single machine.

After the Quick Start Guide, for an advanced setup, please refer to the
[Administration Guide](https://docs.saunafs.com/administration-guide) as a starting
place.

### Building from source

This section assumes you have the necessary dependencies installed. If not,
check the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for a list of dependencies (at least
for Ubuntu) and a more complete guide for compiling from source.

We use `nice` to set the building process to a lower priority, so it doesn't
hog memory and CPU resources. We also set `-j` to the number of cores in your
system to speed up the build process. Note that setting `-j` without nice can
lead to the system running out of memory/hanging.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leil-io/saunafs.github
cd saunafs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
nice -n 16 make -j$(nproc)
```
